Hey, I just made this flowchart in [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), in order to represent my current workflow for my note taking process and research for my job. Sorry for the combination of Spanish and English in the chart, but at least it helps you get some inspiration from that.
I have few years without making any kind of flowchart, so probably it has an incorrect design of any means.

## My Tools

As inventory system I use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), also [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) as highlighter manager and card holder.

My note taking app is [LogSeq](https://logseq.com/), it is OpenSource project that is currently under alpha, a very great option for Roam Research. I truly support the development of this application.

For project planning and development I use [Notion](https://notion.so).

There are my current source of information:

- PDF.
- Kindle Books.
- Web Stuff.

With those main sources of information as part of my workflow, I create this flowchart.

Any feedback or comments, please let me know. we can share more ideas and so on.

Thanks for reading. :)
